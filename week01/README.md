## Task 4: Say I own 857 CDs

Say I own 857 CDs. My friend has written a computer program that uses a webcam
to scan the shelves in my house where I keep my CDs and measure how many I have.
His program says the I have 863 CDs. Define measurement error. What is the
measurement error in my friend's CD-counting device?

- Measurement error is the discrepancy between the numbers used to represent the
  thing that we're measuring and the actual value of the thing we're measuring.

- Since we only have 857 CDs but our friends program claims 863, the measurement
  error is 863 - 857 which is 6


## Task 5: Sketch the shape

- Of a normal distribution
- Of a positively skewed distribution
- Of a negatively skewed distribution
