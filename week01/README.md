# Week 01

## Task 3: What is the level of measurement of the following variables

The level of measurement is the relationship between what is being
measured and the numbers that represent what is being measured.

- The number of downloads of different bands' songs in iTunes
  - This is a discrete variable because downloads are counted by
    the number of downloads (which should be a whole number)

- The names of bands that were downloaded
  - This is a categorical variable because there are many band names

- The position in the iTunes download chart
  - This is a ordinal variable because this category is ordered
    by the ranking/position on the chart

- The money eared by the bands from the downloads
  - This is a continuous variable because the amount can be measured
    in many ways

- The weight of drugs bought by the bands with their royalties
  - This is a continuous variable because the weight can be measured
    in many ways

- The type of drugs bought by the bands with their royalties
  - This is a categorical variable because drugs have many types

- The number of phone numbers that the bands obtained because of their fame
  - This is a discrete variable because the quantity of numbers is a whole number

- The gender of the people giving the bands their phone numbers
  - This is a binary variable because it is either male or female

- The instruments played by the band members
  - This is a categorical variable there are meny different kinds of
    instruments and there are many sub-categories

- The time they had spent learning to play their instruments
  - This is a continuous variable at a minimum because time can be
    measured in many ways

## Task 4: Say I own 857 CDs

Say I own 857 CDs. My friend has written a computer program that uses a webcam
to scan the shelves in my house where I keep my CDs and measure how many I have.
His program says the I have 863 CDs. Define measurement error. What is the
measurement error in my friend's CD-counting device?

- Measurement error is the discrepancy between the numbers used to represent the
  thing that we're measuring and the actual value of the thing we're measuring.

- Since we only have 857 CDs but our friends program claims 863, the measurement
  error is 863 - 857 which is 6

## Task 5: Sketch the shape

- Of a normal distribution

- Of a positively skewed distribution

- Of a negatively skewed distribution
