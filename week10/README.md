## Assignments

1. Fit a Logistic Regression Model to Thoracic Surgery Binary Dataset

For this problem, you will be working with the thoracic surgery data set from
the University of California Irvine machine learning repository. This dataset
contains information on life expectancy in lung cancer patients after surgery.
The underlying thoracic surgery data is in ARFF format. This is a text-based
format with information on each of the attributes. You can load this data using
a package such as foreign or by cutting and pasting the data section into a CSV
file.

Assignment Instructions:
- Fit a binary logistic regression model to the data set that predicts whether
  or not the patient survived for one year (the Risk1Y variable) after the
  surgery. Use the glm() function to perform the logistic regression. See
  Generalized Linear Models for an example. Include a summary using the summary()
  function in your results.

- According to the summary, which variables had the greatest effect on the
  survival rate?

- To compute the accuracy of your model, use the dataset to predict the outcome
  variable. The percent of correct predictions is the accuracy of your model.
  What is the accuracy of your model?

2. Fit a Logistic Regression Model
- Fit a logistic regression model to the binary-classifier-data.csv dataset
- The dataset (found in binary-classifier-data.csv) contains three variables;
  label, x, and y. The label variable is either 0 or 1 and is the output we want
  to predict using the x and y variables.
  - What is the accuracy of the logistic regression classifier?
  - Keep this assignment handy, as you will be comparing your results from this
    week to next week.
