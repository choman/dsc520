You will be working on a research paper for your final project.
This project will include identifying a topic/problem that you 
want to solve using data science.  While the final solution to 
the problem does not need to be provided via programming – you 
will be doing some exploratory data analysis, transformations,
and summary statistics on the data via R.  You are welcome to
create a model based on what you have learned in this course to 
solve the problem, but this is not required.  Instead, a 
recommendation is required for a model or method you would 
implement to solve the problem.  There are 3 steps to this 
project, with the final deliverable being a formal paper 
(completed in R Markdown) that outlines the problem, shows the 
analysis done with the data, and concludes with your 
recommendation for next steps.  Each step provides detailed 
information that you must include in each phase of the project.

  - Identify a topic or a problem that you want to research. 
    Provide an introduction that explains the problem statement
    or topic you are addressing. Why would someone be interested
    in this?  How is it a data science problem?
  - Draft 5-10 Research questions that focus on the problem
    statement/topic.
  - Provide a concise explanation of how you plan to address this
    problem statement.
  - Discuss how your proposed approach will address (fully or
    partially) this problem.
  - Do some digging and find at least 3 datasets that you can use
    to address the issue. (There is not a required number of fields
    or rows for these datasets)
      - Original source where the data was obtained is cited and, 
        if possible, hyperlinked.
      - Source data is thoroughly explained (i.e. what was the
        original purpose of the data, when was it collected, how
        many variables did the original have, explain any
        peculiarities of the source data such as how missing
        values are recorded, or how data was imputed, etc.).
  - Identify the packages that are needed for your project.

  - What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the
    ﬁndings to your research questions?
  - What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn
    to answer your research questions?

You can use the following template for Step 1:

    Research questions
    Approach
    How your approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.
    Data  (Minimum of 3 Datasets - but no requirement on number of fields or rows)
    Required Packages
