# Abstract

My term project


# Step 1

You will be working on a research paper for your final project.
This project will include identifying a topic/problem that you 
want to solve using data science.  While the final solution to 
the problem does not need to be provided via programming – you 
will be doing some exploratory data analysis, transformations,
and summary statistics on the data via R.  You are welcome to
create a model based on what you have learned in this course to 
solve the problem, but this is not required.  Instead, a 
recommendation is required for a model or method you would 
implement to solve the problem.  There are 3 steps to this 
project, with the final deliverable being a formal paper 
(completed in R Markdown) that outlines the problem, shows the 
analysis done with the data, and concludes with your 
recommendation for next steps.  Each step provides detailed 
information that you must include in each phase of the project.

  - Identify a topic or a problem that you want to research. 
    Provide an introduction that explains the problem statement
    or topic you are addressing. Why would someone be interested
    in this?  How is it a data science problem?
  - Draft 5-10 Research questions that focus on the problem
    statement/topic.
  - Provide a concise explanation of how you plan to address this
    problem statement.
  - Discuss how your proposed approach will address (fully or
    partially) this problem.
  - Do some digging and find at least 3 datasets that you can use
    to address the issue. (There is not a required number of fields
    or rows for these datasets)
      - Original source where the data was obtained is cited and, 
        if possible, hyperlinked.
      - Source data is thoroughly explained (i.e. what was the
        original purpose of the data, when was it collected, how
        many variables did the original have, explain any
        peculiarities of the source data such as how missing
        values are recorded, or how data was imputed, etc.).
  - Identify the packages that are needed for your project.

  - What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the
    ﬁndings to your research questions?
  - What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn
    to answer your research questions?

You can use the following template for Step 1:

    Introduction
    Research questions
    Approach
    How your approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.
    Data  (Minimum of 3 Datasets - but no requirement on number of fields or rows)
    Required Packages
    Plots and Table Needs
    Questions for future steps


# Step 2


At this point you should have framed your problem/topic, described the data, and how you plan to solve the problem.  Now you need to move on to the next step of analyzing and preparing the data.

- Data importing and cleaning steps are explained in the text and follow a logical process.  Outline your data preparation and cleansing steps.
- With a clean dataset, show what the final data set looks like. However, do not print off a data frame with 200+ rows; show me the data in the most condensed form possible.
- What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to import and cleanup your dataset?

- Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.
- What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?
- Do you plan to slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information? Explain.
- How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
- What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your questions? Ensure that all graph plots have axis titles, legend if necessary, scales are appropriate, appropriate geoms used, etc.).
- What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your questions?
- Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.

Some additional questions you may want to consider asking yourself as you work through this section of the project:

- What features could you ﬁlter on?
- How could arranging your data in different ways help?
- Can you reduce your data by selecting only certain variables?
- Could creating new variables add new insights?
- Could summary statistics at different categorical levels tell you more?
- How can you incorporate the pipe (%>%) operator to make your code more efﬁcient?

- What does the final data set look like?
- Questions for future steps.

- What information is not self-evident?
- What are different ways you could look at this data?
- How do you plan to slice and dice the data?
- How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
- What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your questions?
- Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.
- Questions for future steps.
