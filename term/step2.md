# Step 2

At this point you should have framed your problem/topic, described the data, and how you plan to solve the problem.  Now you need to move on to the next step of analyzing and preparing the data.

- Data importing and cleaning steps are explained in the text and follow a logical process.  Outline your data preparation and cleansing steps.
- With a clean dataset, show what the final data set looks like. However, do not print off a data frame with 200+ rows; show me the data in the most condensed form possible.
- What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to import and cleanup your dataset?

- Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.
- What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?
- Do you plan to slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information? Explain.
- How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
- What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your questions? Ensure that all graph plots have axis titles, legend if necessary, scales are appropriate, appropriate geoms used, etc.).
- What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your questions?
- Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.

Some additional questions you may want to consider asking yourself as you work through this section of the project:

- What features could you ﬁlter on?
- How could arranging your data in different ways help?
- Can you reduce your data by selecting only certain variables?
- Could creating new variables add new insights?
- Could summary statistics at different categorical levels tell you more?
- How can you incorporate the pipe (%>%) operator to make your code more efﬁcient?


You can use the following template for Step 2:

- How to import and clean my data
- What does the final data set look like?
- Questions for future steps.

- What information is not self-evident?
- What are different ways you could look at this data?
- How do you plan to slice and dice the data?
- How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
- What types of plots and tables will help you to illustrate the findings to your questions?
- Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.
- Questions for future steps.
